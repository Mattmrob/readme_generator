# README GENERATOR

## Description

This project allows users to generate a high-quality readme using Node, fs, and inquirer.

## Installation

Download this repository along with a code editing software such as Visual Studo Code. With your editing software installed, make sure to install Node. Once both Node and a code software is installed, go into the "content" folder from this repository and open it in your Node / integrated terminal. Type "npm i" into the Node terminal to install all needed modules and packages.

## Usage

After installing all required files, while in the content folder in your code editing software, type "node index.js" to open the index file in Node. The user will then be prompted with a series of questions that must be answered. The user can type in a response and press enter to answer a question - the license question will require the user to select 1 license, of which you can use the arrow keys to move up and down with enter being used to select.

Once all questions are answered, a README.md will be generated with the user's specified info.
